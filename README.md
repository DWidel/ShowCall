Notifications of new calls when using CallAttendant

This is a program that sits in the notification tray of your PC.  Once a second or so it downloads the main page for the callattendant program https://emxsys.github.io/callattendant/  and parses it to see if there have been any new calls.  If so it shows a form similar to a notification with the call information.  If the program is working it has an icon in the form of a yellow telephone, if not a gray telephone.  If there are messages the phone has a red dot.  Clicking on the icon brings up the webpage for Call Attendant. Right clicking brings up a menu that allows you to change some of the settings, or exit the program.
